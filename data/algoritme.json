This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as sorting a list of items. Algorithms are used in computer science to solve problems and perform tasks efficiently.  Before writing an algorithm, it is usual that you write them in the form of a flowchart or a pseudocode.",

Flowcharts are used in designing algorithms, documenting processes, and managing workflows. <br>Flowcharts usually take on a specific structure, always started and ended by START and STOP signal in the form of an oval shape. The process—divisions and other operations—is represented by a rectangle, decision-making by a diamond, and input/output by a parallelogram.",
