The committees are based off of the committees in MUN (I.e. UNESCO(education), WHO(Health & Medicine), ILO (Human Rights in Labour Enviroment)), & the participants are expected to form a solution to said issues. Each participants then chose how important this topic is to their country. & They have to follow the opinions & stance of their country. They are then permitted to debate, compromise, & negotiate a solution to solve said issue, which can go south very quickly. After all is said & done, they are told to make a resoltuion paper, which contained the outcome of the MUN, & what solutions they came up with. Each countries don't write this however, as they are told to teamwork with the allies they made along the way. Though there are instances where a country decide on writing this paper alone.",
