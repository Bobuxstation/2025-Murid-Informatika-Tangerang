        <h1>WHY WE'RE HERE</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Globally, over 1 in 5 people in the world do not have the means to aquire a proper education. Whether it's
            due to their financial situation, poor facility provided by the government, or their medical condition.
            There's no denying that these people do not deserve to be in this situation. With this kind of statistic,
            there's no wonder why over 8% of the population is living in poverty. They do not have the means to get a
            proper education, which caused them to only be able to get a low paying, & physically demanding job, which
            will only be enough to let them barely scrape by, which caused them to not be able to get proper education.
            Because of this vicious cycle, many individual that's living in poverty, won't get out of it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This is where we step in. We believe that everyone, no matter their height, skin color, gender, or weight,
            deserve to be able to learn like anyone else. Which is why we made this website so that material & education
            can be much easier to access for everyone, with no charge whatsoever. We are able to stay afloat by relying
            on donations from other like minded people who supported our cause & are eager ebough to at least contribue
            to this attempt at making a change. A little goes along way, & you (yes, you) can also be a part of this
            change by giving us a small portion of your fortune.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A little goes a long way, & we would truly appreciate even the smallest things you'll donate to us so that we
            can not only improve our website for the better, but also to give us an opportunity to host many future
            events for charity.</p>
